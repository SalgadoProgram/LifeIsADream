# LifeIsADream
This is an opportunity to participate in a collaborative, interdisciplinary, public-facing digital humanities project whose outcome is early-stage prototypes of a video game adaptation. The work this project adapts is a classic of world theater: the seventeenth-century Spanish play Life Is a Dream by Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca.
